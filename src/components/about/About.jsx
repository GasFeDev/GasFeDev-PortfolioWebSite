                <h5>Experience</h5>
                <small>
                  I have worked on the creation and implementation of smart
                  contracts, integrating them into Web3 projects. My experience
                  includes the design and development of decentralized
                  applications (dApps), database management, API creation and
                  consumption, and the implementation of solutions. I have
                  mastered both frontend and backend technologies, leveraging
                  design libraries and modern tools to deliver robust, scalable,
                  and high-quality solutions. My approach combines advanced
                  technical skills and in-depth knowledge of blockchain
                  architectures for effective project management. In addition to
                  my work as a Full Stack Blockchain Developer, I also serve as
                  a university professor in Blockchain Development, where I
                  share my knowledge and expertise with the next generation of
                  developers. As a professional with a background in Industrial
                  Engineering, I bring a strategic focus to process optimization
                  and efficient project management in all of my work.
