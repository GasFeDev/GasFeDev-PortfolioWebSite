                  creation, deployment of applications in Docker containers, and

              Summary: An Argentine national currently residing in Malarg√ºe,
              Mendoza (Argentina). Freelance developer with skills in web
              development, blockchain integration, database management, API
              creation, and deploying applications using Docker containers.
              Proficient in both frontend and backend development, leveraging a
              wide range of technologies and tools. Committed to professional
              growth and continuous learning, taking my first steps in the world
              of programming in 2021. Hold a degree in Industrial Engineering
              from the National Technological University (2017). Ever since I
              entered the world of Programming, I felt immense satisfaction with
              each step I took and with every knowledge I acquired. That's why,
              regardless of the learning and experience gained through my
              Degree, my short-term or medium-term goal is to earn one hundred
              percent of my income as a Developer, and above all, to work the
              rest of my days in something that I am passionate about and brings
              me happiness.
